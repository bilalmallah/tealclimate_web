  CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites

  beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and
  conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally
  identifiable information from California ' consumers to post a conspicuous
  privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
  and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this
  policy.

<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
<p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>

  found on the home page of our website;

  Policy Page;

<p>
  0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at

<p>Our Policy on "Do Not Track" Signals:</p>
